                The old bus stand in Mayiladuthurai is the Kamarajar Bus Stand, established by the Mayiladuthurai Municipality in the early 1960s. Located at the heart of the town on Gandhi Nagar, it historically served as the main transportation hub, connecting the town with northern and western districts. Despite the later addition of a second town bus stand near Varadachariar Park to manage some traffic flow, the Kamarajar bus stand continues to function as a crucial and overcrowded terminal. Originally designed for a much smaller volume, it now handles over a thousand trips daily, leading to significant congestion, especially in the surrounding areas. The age of the facility is evident in its poor maintenance and inadequate basic amenities like usable toilets and sufficient seating, which frequently draw complaints from commuters and local activists, even as the construction of a new, modern bus stand at Manakudi nears completion to finally alleviate the pressure on this vital, decades-old central hub.
